# Dynamo-Neo4j
This is a research project held in Aalto University, Department of Civil Engineering.
The project aims for the dynamic integration between [Autodesk Revit](http://www.autodesk.com/products/revit-family/overview) and [Neo4j Graph Database](https://neo4j.com/) via [DynamoBIM](http://dynamobim.org/) as a middleware. With this connection, all the interactions of Autodesk Revit end-user can be captured and saved for further design dependency analysis, equipment collection, bill of quantities, facility management.

Further use case scenarios are needed to test and measure the usability and applicability of this integration.
